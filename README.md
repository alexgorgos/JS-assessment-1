Exercises:

1. In a HTML page, create a container with 3 circles of different colors.
2. Add click events on the circles. On click, display the color of the circle in the console.
3. Add a button under the three circles.
4. When clicking the button, randomly add a square or a circle in the above container. 
5. Circles must have the same functionality as the previous added circles (meaning the color and the click functionality). 
6. When clicking on a square, display in the console "I am a square".

Bonus:
You are given a list of points in a 2D space. Each point has X and Y coordinates.
You must find a vertical line for which ALL points have a symmetric. Points are symmetric if the distance between each point and the vertical line is equal.  
Display in the console the coordinates of this line, or "None" if there is no line that meets this condition.

Here is an example:
